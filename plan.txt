Components needed: 

(1) board, 
(5) board head, 
    (2) mine-counter, 
    (3) timer, 
    (4) reset button (for loss), 
(6) Game
    (7) Row
    (8) Grid item

open function:

clicking on an open cell does nothing
clicking on a closed cell should set cell to open
if the cell has a mine, game is over
if the cell does not have a mine, cell shows how many mines are nearby (this means we need a method to update cells with mines nearby as we randomly assign mines?)
if no mines are nearby, open all adjacent cells (recursive)

?? reset the board if we click on mine on first turn (seems unncessary to me)
